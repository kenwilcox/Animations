Animations
==========

Playing around with Animations in Swift.

Pretty painless updating for universal. Project Settings -> General -> Deployment Info changed from iPhone to Universal. Done. However I was already using constraints with an Any/Any storyboard.

Two separate examples so far. The first is a slow trippy animation that has a number of squares go from left to right, back to left, fall down, then shoot into the "sky" changing colors along the way. The user can select the number of squares

The second example is just a square that you can fling around the screen.
